What's This?!
=============

This page collects all todo blocks throughout osb-learn. They're here as a way to highlight the particular portions of the documents that either need more content, an image, or just something that, well, needs to be done!

Todo blocks are split in three different priorities, seen by the block's lefthand border color.

    - **Low**: Green. Not a big deal. Would be nice to have done.
    - **Medium**: Yellow. For this to be done would help the page a great deal.
    - **High**: Red. Basically, this page or portion is virtually blank. It needs content.

Unfortunately, there isn't any finer organization at this point unless I extend Sphinx's todo extension. For now, that in itself is a low priority. (Ha!)

How Can I Contribute?!
======================

If you'd like to make edits to the documents directly and propose changes that way, then you should take a look at :ref:`contributing through Github<meta_contributing_github>`. Github is a great way in collaborating online coding projects and efforts such as these!

Our Discord server also has a channel to propose and make changes there too.

You will be credited as a contributor for the section if you do help in the effort of finishing one of these Todo blocks! :)

Todos Todos!
