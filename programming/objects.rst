Sneak Peek
==========
By the end of this lesson, you should be able to...

- Create your own classes defining custom objects in your storyboard.
- Define functionality and logic for objects for further customization in storyboards.
- Utilize Script Libraries to reuse class definitions between effects.

Storyboarding Dream
===================
I'm going to write this lesson largely example-based with a custom storyboard, like a case study. However, it highlights more on concepts, their definitions, and things like that.

So, what should be covered?

- Scenario to introduce the need to create class objects
    - Maybe a set of particles having their own autonomous behavior?
    - It can be some group of particles that are moving and meshing around together
    - Or it can be literally like some class-oriented example with different types (e.g. Pokemon)
        - That sticks better, right?

- Creating a class
    - Members / Methods
    - Constructors
- Scripts Library
    - Reusing that (examples!!!)

So this should surmount to most needs with making a class, but what else can be done?

- Utility Libraries
    - Static objects/classes
- Inherited classes
    - Overrides!
    - Explain how the storyboarded effect is essentially an inherited class
